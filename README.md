# Project Inform College Choice
We should say something about this project here.

## Installation
This site is made with [Jekyll], which you can install with:

```sh
gem install github-pages
```

(Note: depending on how Ruby was installed on your computer, you may need to
prefix the above command with `sudo`.)

To start up the local server, run:

```sh
jekyll serve -w
```

Then visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it. The `-w`
(or `--watch`) flag tells Jekyll to rebuild the relevant pages when you edit
the source files.

## Frontend Tools
- Styles: we're using [Sass], which is bundled with [Jekyll].
- Font: [Montserrat] hosted on [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/).
- Charts will be rendered with [D3].
