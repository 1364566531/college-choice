            <p>&ldquo;Understanding the costs of higher education is critical to both consumers and to policymakers. Complications arise, however, because there are a variety of different ways to measure costs and <span class="insight-highlight">the price students pay often differs from the &lsquo;sticker price&rsquo; they see.</span> Tuition, sometimes called the &lsquo;sticker price,&rsquo; is what institutions generally advertise as the price charged to attend. The broadest measure of costs to students is cost of attendance. The average net price to students at each institution is defined as the cost of attendance less all grant aid for federal aid recipients paying the in-state or in-district tuition rate.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Two-year public institutions (community colleges), which serve <span class="insight-highlight">approximately 40 percent of students,</span> are among the most affordable options for students. In particular, they may offer an accessible and flexible educational option for the growing section of the student body that is older, working, needs remedial classes, and/or can only take classes part-time. Given the differences in the missions and student compositions between two-year and four-year institutions, <span class="insight-highlight">data users should consider separating schools by level when evaluating college performance.</span>&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;While there is variation in the amount of debt and fraction of students borrowing by sector, on average, <span class="insight-highlight">students at private for-profit two-year and four-year institutions have high rates of borrowing and their graduates often have large amounts of debt.</span> While debt per se may not be problematic where students are able to repay their loans, it should be paired with other data, such as completion rates and post-school earnings, to provide a more comprehensive picture of student outcomes.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;A close look at the median cumulative debt measure shows that <span class="insight-highlight">typical students</span> at many institutions &#8212; especially private two- and four-year institutions &#8212; <span class="insight-highlight">borrow up to the federal loan limits.</span> There are large spikes in the distribution of total borrowing that correspond with the Direct Loan limit for dependent undergraduates at each type of institution.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Loan repayment rates offer a new way to consider borrower behavior, and may convey more information about student debt management than cohort default rates (CDR). The overall three-year repayment rate for all undergraduate institutions, weighted by the number of students borrowing at each school, was 63 percent in the combined 2010 and 2011 repayment cohorts. <span class="insight-highlight">37 percent of students were thus not meeting the repayment metric—either they were in default or were making monthly payments that were not reducing their loan balance.</span> As a point of comparison, the three-year CDR was 13 percent for all students in the 2011 repayment cohort.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;There is a great deal of earnings variation within a college, so that students with good outcomes at low-earning schools often perform better than students with poor outcomes at high-earning schools. Earnings variation can be explained at least in part by the program in which students choose to study; <span class="insight-highlight">program-level earnings data will be available moving forward, beginning with the 2012 cohort.</span>&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Mean and median earnings among workers 6 to 10 years after first enrolling in an institution provide an overall assessment of the degree to which past attendees of an institution are able to find jobs that pay well. Individuals who are identified as currently enrolled are excluded from the calculation. <span class="insight-highlight">The typical four-year college’s median earnings are $40,500, while the corresponding number is $29,800 for two-year and $24,550 for less-than-two-year institutions.</span> Control (public, private, or for-profit) is also related to earnings, with for-profits generally having lower earnings.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;<span class="insight-highlight">The data in the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) on enrollment intensity and transfer status are both of poor quality for Pell-only students prior to 2012.</span> Because of this, the data do not support reporting completion rates disaggregated by full-time and part-time status, or first-time and not-first-time status. Moreover, since transfers can only be identified if the student receives Title IV aid at the transfer-in institution, NSLDS cannot reliably identify all transfer students.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;For students with loans, NSLDS completion measures tend to look similar to other data sources, particularly in more recent years. However, reported data for students who only receive grants remains a challenge. As result, <span class="insight-highlight">the data are not currently recommended for consumer information applications,</span> as they are not sufficiently accurate in many cases; but they are promising for the future.&rdquo;</p>
