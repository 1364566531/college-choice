      <h1>Data Documentation</h1>

      <p>The College Scorecard project is designed to increase transparency, putting the power in the hands of students and families to compare colleges and see how well schools are preparing their students to be successful. This project provides more data than ever before to compare college costs and outcomes, and can help students weigh the tradeoffs of different colleges, accounting for their own needs.</p>

      <p>These data are provided through federal financial aid and tax information, and provide insight into the performance of schools eligible to receive federal financial aid, and at the outcomes of the students of those schools.</p>

      <h2>Accuracy and privacy</h2>

      <p>Note that for many elements, we have taken additional steps to ensure data are stable from year to year and representative of a certain number of students. For most elements, data are pooled across years to reduce year-over-year variability in figures (i.e. repayment rate, completion rate, earnings). Moreover, for elements that we expect to publish for consumer use, a separate version of the element is available that suppresses the data for schools with fewer than 30 students in the denominator. All National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and Treasury elements are protected for privacy purposes; those data are shown as PrivacySuppressed.</p>

      <p>Additionally, many elements are available only for Title IV recipients, or students who receive federal grants and loans. These data are reported at the individual level to NSLDS, used to distribute federal aid, by schools, and published at the aggregate institutional level. While some schools report these data at the campus level (8-digit OPE ID), we have rolled those up to the institution level (6-digit OPE ID).</p>

      <h2>Categories of Data</h2>

      <p>The data available from this website covers a wide range of topics. An overview of the available categories of data is below. For detailed information on each categories and its individual fields, see our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/data_dictionary.pdf">Data Dictionary</a>. Details on methodology and policy are in the <a href="#">Technical Paper</a> and <a href="#">Policy Paper</a>.</p>
