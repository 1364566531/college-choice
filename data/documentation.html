      <h1>Data Documentation</h1>

      <p>This page provides more details about the robust data set behind the College Scorecard efforts. You can get information on accessing and understanding the API; download the entire dataset spanning nearly 20 years of data and covering multiple sources including IPEDS, NSLDS, and Department of Treasury; or download smaller data sets, including the data provided on the College Scorecard.</p>

      <p>You can also learn more about the data through our full <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DocumentationReport.pdf”>Documentation Report</a> and the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/CollegeScorecardDataDictionary_09-04-2015.pdf">Data Dictionary</a>.</p>
      
      <p>For those who want to understand more about ways to use the data, important information is contained in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/BetterInformationForBetterCollegeChoiceAndInstitutionalPerformance.pdf">Policy Paper</a>, which describes the goals of the College Scorecard and the use of data on the site, and the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/UsingFederalDataToMeasureAndImprovePerformance.pdf">Technical Paper</a>, which offers an in-depth exploration of the data and methodologies considered and used for this project.</p>

      <h2>Accuracy and Privacy</h2>

      <p>Note that for many elements, we have taken additional steps to ensure data are stable from year to year and representative of a certain number of students. For most elements, data are pooled across years to reduce year-over-year variability in figures (i.e. repayment rate, completion rate, earnings). Moreover, for elements that we expect to publish for consumer use, a separate version of the element is available that suppresses the data for schools with fewer than 30 students in the denominator. All National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and Treasury elements are protected for privacy purposes; those data are shown as PrivacySuppressed.</p>

      <p>Additionally, many elements are available only for Title IV recipients, or students who receive federal grants and loans. These data are reported at the individual level to NSLDS, used to distribute federal aid, by schools, and published at the aggregate institutional level. While some schools report these data at the campus level (8-digit OPE ID), we have rolled those up to the institution level (6-digit OPE ID).</p>

      <h2>Categories of Data</h2>

      <p>The data available from this website covers a wide range of topics. An overview of the available categories of data is below. For detailed information on each categories and its individual fields, see our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/CollegeScorecardDataDictionary_09-04-2015.pdf">Data Dictionary</a>. Details on methodology and policy are in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/UsingFederalDataToMeasureAndImprovePerformance.pdf">Technical Paper</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/BetterInformationForBetterCollegeChoiceAndInstitutionalPerformance.pdf">Policy Paper</a>.</p>

            <div id="earnings-content" aria-hidden="true">

              <p>One of the most common reasons students cite in choosing to go to college is the expansion of employment opportunities. To that end, data on the earnings and employment prospects of former students can provide key information. To measure the labor market outcomes of individuals attending institutions of higher education, data on cohorts of federally aided students were linked with earnings data from de-identified tax records and reported back at the aggregate, institutional level.</p>

              <p>There are two notable limitations that researchers should keep in mind for all of these metrics. First, the data are not yet available to produce program-level earnings data. Research suggests that the variation across programs within a school may be even greater than aggregate earnings across schools; for instance, STEM and health majors frequently earn more than students who study in other fields. And second, the data include only Title IV-receiving students, so figures may not be representative of schools with a low proportion of Title IV-eligible students. Additionally, the data are restricted to students who are not enrolled (enrolled means having an in-school deferment status for at least 30 days of the measurement year), so students who are currently enrolled in graduate school at the time of measurement are excluded.</p>
